POC - WebClient Proxy

Testing a http proxy which uses io.vertx.rxjava.ext.web.client.WebClient for creating server connections. There is a client, proxy and a server. When the application is run, client invokes single request to proxy, which in turn forwards it to the server. The requests received by proxy server can be buffered (rxSendBuffer - read body from client request and write into the server request) or streamed (rxSendStream - pass client request object itself to the server request).

Was facing some issue with second approach - in the proxy layer, client request used to fail the stream indicating request body already read. Trying to reproduce the same.

System Requirements:

    Java 1.8
    Maven 3.x

How to build: Use following maven build command mvn clean install

How to run: Starting point for this module is AppStarter. By defaultWhen running application, an optional flag -DproxyAsBuffer=true can be passed to force the proxy to buffer the request body and then send it to the server. By default, proxy tries to send the request as stream.

After successfully building the module with maven command, use below commands to run the application:

    Run to stream the request: java -jar webclient-stream-proxy-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
    Run to buffer the request: java -jar -DproxyAsBuffer=true webclient-stream-proxy-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
